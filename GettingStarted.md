## Dart Installation

To begin your journey with Dart, you need to install the Dart SDK (Software Development Kit) on your machine. The SDK includes the Dart compiler, core libraries, and other essential tools for Dart development.

Visit the official Dart website for installation instructions and download the Dart SDK for your operating system: [Dart Install Page](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

After installation, you can check if Dart is properly set up by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
dart --version
